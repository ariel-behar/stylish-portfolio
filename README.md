# stylish-portfolio
A project I did to practice my photoshop skills by creating a mockup website and incorporating the design into an actual html(bootstrap based) website. 

# Project Description:

Portfolio site for a fictional web and graphic design company. One pager with no actual functionalities and no other purpose apart from pure Photoshop practice and Bootstrap based recreation.

# My Role in the Project:

The Photoshop design for this project is not mine although I did compose the actual PSD file. The conversion to an HTML based website is entirely on me and it was my first project on which I practiced accurate recreation of an already existing design. Having the Photoshop file available in front of me helped me finish this project in about 2 hours.

# Technologies Used:

•HTML •CSS •SASS •Bootstrap •Adobe Photoshop
Project Launched in:     Oct 2017
